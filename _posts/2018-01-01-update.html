<p>I&#8217;ve made some changes to this site. Happy New Year. I bet you will not even notice what they are. (OK. Ok. Those who look closely will note that I have also changed the copyright information. No longer is there a Creative Commons license on The Contrafabulists material. This really doesn&#8217;t change much, I promise. <em>It just means you have to ask our permission</em> before republishing our work.
