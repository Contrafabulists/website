<p>We have started work on a new Contrafabulists project: <a href="http://predictions.contrafabulists.com">predictions.contrafabulists.com</a>. 

<p>We plan to track the predictions made about the future; and we'll see who's right, who's wrong, and who's committed to a certain technological vision of tomorrow.</p>

<p>How many years until self-driving cars? How many years until robots take our jobs? What's the history of these predictions? What can we learn from them?</p>
