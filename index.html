<p><strong>Kin Lane</strong> has spent the last decade or more obsessed with APIs, studying how our digital works and often doesn't work. While he is good at what he does and enjoys telling stories about how the digital machine works--he is slowly losing his soul in this world, and looking for more nourishment at the edge of our physical and digital worlds.</p>
